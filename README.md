How to Guide
======================
# Description
This is a simple Android native application that shows the latest photo streams from 500px and allows you to set them as wallpapers.

# Things you need to change
1. Make sure you go to 500px's developer site and register to get your own API key. Then add it to Constants.java.
2. This app uses UniversalImageLoader (https://github.com/nostra13/Android-Universal-Image-Loader), so make sure you add this dependency to your project.
